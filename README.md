# UtilityTools

Some Python convenient script

- changeName.py --> change recursively in one directory
- 'replace text in file/ReplaceText.py' ==> replace text in one file to new text
- DataFrameComparing.py --> compare two Pandas Dataframes and check if they are samecompletely( Very slow when dataset is too big )
